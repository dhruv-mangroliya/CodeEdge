                Our Founding Story
              </h1>
              <p className="text-base font-medium text-richblack-300 lg:w-[95%]">
              In 2022, our team participated in a competitive business pitch with our innovative idea an e-learning platform tailored for software engineering courses. Winning the gold medal was a pivotal moment that sparked my determination to bring our concept to life by developing a dedicated website. Despite starting with limited web development experience, I embarked on a journey of self-teaching and hands-on learning, completing over 10 projects along the way. This journey not only enabled me to successfully launch the platform but also underscored the importance of perseverance and continuous learning in the tech industry.

              <p className="text-base font-medium text-richblack-300 lg:w-[95%]">
              After months of hard work and perseverance, I successfully launched the website, marking a significant milestone in our journey. This achievement not only validated our original concept but also underscored the importance of resilience and continuous learning in the ever-evolving tech industry. Looking ahead, I am inspired to further innovate and expand our platform to better serve the educational needs of aspiring software engineers worldwide.
